Section 4 Practice Problems
1. Add const to the methods of your Fraction class that are appropriate



2. Create constant static variables in the Fraction class for: a half, a third, a fourth and a fifth that we can be used outside of the class



3. Does the Fraction class require a copy constructor? Why or why not?
yes, under a Fraction class obj a, we will need to call another Fraction class obj b; therefore, this is a copy constructo (complier does this for us)


4. Implement two new methods on the fraction class called GetNumerator and GetDenominator. Make these methods inline.
