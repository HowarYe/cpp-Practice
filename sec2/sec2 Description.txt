1. Create and implement a class called Time. Have a method on the class called Init that takes in the hour, minute and second in 24 hour time.



This class should be able to:



- Display the time in 12 hour format

- eg. 12:10:01 am - 12 hours, 10 minutes and 1 second in the morning



- Display the time in 24 hour format

- eg. 22:10:05 - this is 10:10:05 pm in 12 hour time



You should not have to change the internal data representation of the class to display in either format
