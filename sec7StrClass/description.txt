Section 7 Practice Problems
Implement a class called String, this will represent an array of characters like "Hello"



This class should be able to:



- Have a constructor that takes in a string literal (ie. String("Hello"))

- Have a default constructor that is the empty string

- concatenate two Strings together and returns a new String object

- Check if two String objects are equal

- find a substring and return the index of the first character of that substring

- return a String that is substring from a starting position and a length



- Be displayed with cout (from <iostream>) - eg:



String myString = "Hello";

cout << myString << endl;



- return the length of the String object

- return the character at an index

- copy String types from one  to  another either through functions or assignment

- Set the String and string literals to a new string using operator equals

- Append a character to the string using operator+ (this should change the length of the String object)

- Append a String object to the current String object using operator+ (this should change the length of the String object)

- return a const char* version of the string



Does this class require a destructor? If so, implement it.
